# Amalthea - A Kubernetes operator for Jupyter servers

This project defines a custom `JupyterServer`
[resource](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/helm-chart/amalthea/templates/crd.yaml)
for Kubernetes and implements a Kubernetes operator which controls the lifecycle
of custom `JupyterServer` objects.

## Example

Once Amalthea is installed in a cluster through the helm chart, deploying a
jupyter server for a user `Jane Doe` with email `jane.doe@example.com` is as easy
as applying the following YAML file to the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: amalthea.dev/v1alpha1
kind: JupyterServer
metadata:
  name: janes-spark-session
  namespace: datascience-workloads
spec:
  jupyterServer:
    image: jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest
  routing:
    host: jane.datascience.example.com
    path: /spark-session
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secretName: example-com-wildcard-tls
  auth:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      issuerUrl: https://auth.example.com
      clientId: jupyter-servers
      clientSecret: 5912adbd5f946edd4bd783aa168f21810a1ae6181311e3c35346bebe679b4482
      authorizedEmails:
        - jane.doe@example.com
    token: ""
```

For the full configuration options check out the
[CRD](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/helm-chart/amalthea/templates/crd.yaml)
as well as the [section on patching](#patching-a-jupyterserver).

## What's "inside" a JupyterServer resource

The `JupyterServer` custom resource defines a bundle of standard Kubernetes
resources that handle the following aspects of running a Jupyter server in a
Kubernetes cluster:

- Routing through the creation of an ingress object and a service to expose the
  Jupyter server
- Access control through integration with existing OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  providers
- Some failure recovery thanks to running the Jupyter server using a
  statefulSet controller and by backing it with a persistent volume
  (optional).

When launching a Jupyter server, the custom resource spec is used to
render the jinja templates defined
[here](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/controller/templates).
The rendered templates are then applied to the cluster, resulting in the
creation of the following K8s resources:

- A statefulSet whose pod spec has two containers, tha actual Jupyter server and
  an [oauth2 proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) which is
  running in front of the Jupyter server
- A PVC which will be mounted into the Jupyter server
- A configmap to hold some non-secret configuration
- A secret to hold some secret configuration
- A service to expose the pod defined in the statefulSet
- An ingress to make the Jupyter server outside reachable from outside of the
  cluster

## Patching a JupyterServer

We intentionally keep the configuration options through the jinja templates
relatively limited to cover only what we believe to be the frequent use cases.
However, as part of the custom resource spec, one can pass a list of
[json](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) or
[json merge](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) patches, which will
be applied to the resource specifications _after_ the rendering of the Jinja
templates. Through patching, one has the complete freedom to add, remove or
change K8s resources which are created as part of the custom resource object.

## Motivation and use cases

The main use case of Amalthea is to provide a layer on top of which developers
can build kubernetes-native applications that allow their users to spin-up and
manage Jupyter servers. We do not see Amalthea as a standalone tool 
used by end users, as creating Jupyter servers with Amalthea requires access to
the Kubernetes API.

### Comparison to JupyterHub

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the standard
application for serving Jupyter servers to multiple users. Unlike Amalthea,
JupyterHub _is_ designed to be an application for the end user to interact with,
and it can run on Kubernetes as well as on standalone servers. It therefore
comes "batteries included" with a web frontend, user management, a database that
keeps track of running servers, a configurable web proxy, etc.

The intended scope of Amalthea is much smaller than that. Specifically:

- Amalthea requires that there is already an OpenID Connect provider in the
  application stack.
- Amalthea itself is stateless. All state is stored as Kubernetes objects in
  etcd.
- Amalthea uses the Kubernetes-native ingress- and service concepts for dynamically
  adding and removing routes as Jupyter servers come and go, instead of relying on 
  an additoinal proxy for routing.

## What's in the repo

The
[helm-chart/amalthea](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/helm-chart/amalthea)
directory contains a chart which installs the custom resource definiton
(optional) and the controller. The helm chart templates therefore contain the
[Custom Resource Definition](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/helm-chart/amalthea/templates/crd.yaml)
of the `JupyterServer` resource. The
[controller](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea/tree/main/controller)
directory contains the logic of that operator which is based on the very nice
[kopf framework](https://github.com/nolar/kopf).

## Testing Amalthea

The easiest way to try amalthea out is to install it in a K8s cluster. If you
dont have a K8s cluster handy you can also just use
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). Further sesctions in the documentation give
more details and information on how to do this.

After installing the helm chart you can start creating `jupyterserver`
resources. We have example manifests that are ready to be deployed with just a
few edits in the `examples` folder in this repository.

Amalthea can work with any image from the
[Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html).
But you can also build your own using the Juyter Docker Stacks Images as a base.
However, there are a few requirements for an image to work with Amalthea:

- The container should use port 8888.
- The configuration files at `/etc/jupyter/` should not be overwritten. But you
  have complete freedom to override these configurations by either (1) passing
  command line arguments to the `jupyter` command or start scripts or (2)
  creating configuration files in locations which are more preferred than
  `/etc/jupyter/` such as the `.jupyter` folder in the user home directory. See
  [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use/jupyter-directories.html#configuration-files)
  for more information about which locations you can use to store and override
  the jupyter configuration.

## Amalthea development and contributing

You have found a bug or you are missing a feature? We would be happy to hear
from you, and even happier to receive a pull request :)

### Requirements

For Amalthea development you will need python 3,
[pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today),
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation),
[kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and
[helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Kind

The easiest way to set up a cluster that will let you develop and test a feature
is to use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). Kind runs a whole K8s cluster in
docker and it can easily be used to run and test amalthea. We use kind for our
integration tests too.

### Running Kopf/Amalthea locally

During development, Kopf-based operators can be executed locally using your
local kubectl context. See `kopf run --help` for more information. In oder to do
this, you first need to install the `JupyterServer` custom resource definiton
defined in the helm charts template directory. It is also convenient to develop
Amalthea using a kubectl context which has the same (minimal) roles assigned
that Amalthea will run with when deployed through the helm chart. For this
purpose, we provide a small script `utils/configure_local_dev.py` which creates
a service account together with a role and a role binding and configures a
kubectl context that uses this service account.

### Example for a development workflow based on kind

After cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies, executing
the following commands should get you up and running:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
kind create cluster
kubectl create ns amalthea-testing
pipenv run utils/configure_local_dev.py -n amalthea-testing
pipenv run kopf run --dev -n amalthea-testing kopf_entrypoint.py
```

Unfortunately, [kopf auto reloading](https://github.com/nolar/kopf/issues/237)
is not yet implemented. Therefore, after editing the code, you have to terminate
and restart kopf. Once you are done working and you want to remove any traces of
Amalthea from your cluster and your kubectl context, run

```bash
pipenv run utils/cleanup_local_dev.py -n amalthea-testing --use-context
kind-kind
```

Note that `kind-kind` should be replaced with the name of the context that you
would like to set as default _after_ removing the context which has been created
during the test execution. Finally, if you also want to remove your kind
cluster, run

```bash
kind delete cluster
```

### Testing

A combination of unit- and integration tests are executed through pytest. The
integration tests run in the `default` namespace of the cluster defined in your
current kubectl context, and they will temporarily modify your kubectl config to
use a dedicated context with mimimal access right for the test execution.
Furthermore, the tests will temporarily install the `JupyterServer` custom
resource definition (CRD), so if you already have that CRD installed, please
delete it before running the tests. By installing the CRD in the \tests we
ensure that the correct, up-to-date CRD is being tested and not an older version
left over from past work or tests. Overall we thus recommend that you create a
new kind cluster to run the tests.

In a fresh cluster you can run the test suite by executing

```bash
pipenv run pytest
```

in the root directory of the repository.

## Why is this project called Amalthea?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalthea), the name
Amalthea stands for:

- one of Jupiters many moons
- the foster-mother of Zeus (ie Jupiter)
- a unicorn
- a container ship

Also, it's another Greek name for something Kubernetes related.
