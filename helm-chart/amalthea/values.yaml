scope:
  # It is recommended to limit the scope of Amalthea to some
  # explicitly mentioned namespaces for two reasons:
  # 1. Amalthea needs pretty extensive permissions on the namespace
  #    in which it operates.
  # 2. Cluster-wide network policies do not yet exist in Kubernetes.
  #    Therefore, no network policies are automatically added for
  #    cluster-wide deployments and admins will need to set up appropriate
  #    network policies manually.
  clusterWide: false
  # Namespaces are ignored if clusterWide is set to true.

deployCrd: true # whether to deploy the jupyterserver CRD

# Enable a network policy to limit ingress to the controller
# and one network policy per namespace within the amalthea scope
# to limit ingress and egress from/to the jupyter servers.
#
# Note that until cluster-wide network policies are available in
# Kubernetes (https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2091),
# enabling network policies won't do anything if the scope of the
# operator is set to clusterWide.
