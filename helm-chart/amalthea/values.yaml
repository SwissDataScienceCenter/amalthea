scope:
  # It is recommended to limit the scope of Amalthea to some
  # explicitly mentioned namespaces for two reasons:
  # 1. Amalthea needs pretty extensive permissions on the namespace
  #    in which it operates.
  # 2. Cluster-wide network policies do not yet exist in Kubernetes.
  #    Therefore, no network policies are automatically added for
  #    cluster-wide deployments and admins will need to set up appropriate
  #    network policies manually.
  clusterWide: false
  # Namespaces should not be provided if clusterWide is true.
  # If the deployment is not clusterwide, then there are two options: 
  # 1. Specify the namespaces where amalthea should operate
  # 2. Do not define namespaces at all, in which case amalthea
  #    will only operate in the namespace where the helm chart is deployed.

    # # Kubernetes (https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2091),
    # # enabling network policies for the sessions won't do anything if the scope of the
    # # operator is set to clusterWide.
    ingress:
      # # The ingress network policy can be used to prevent ingress into the jupyter server
      # # from everywhere except the pods and namespaces captured by the selectors below. For
      # # example you can use this to allow ingress into the sessions only from a specific
      # # kubernetes ingress resource - i.e. only nginx ignress controller pods can access the sessions.

      client_timeout: 600
  # # Configure the use of timeout, delay and backoff for the successful creation

# and the stats provided by the jupyter server /api/status endpoint. The culling 
# section of the custom resource definition of JupyterServer can be used to control
# on a per-server basis whether a server is ever culled and also if it is culled then
