                            API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.
