                        A token that will be passed to the `--ServerApp.token` option when running
                        the Jupyter server and needed when first accessing the Jupyter server. The
                        options are:
                        - By leaving this field empty, a token will be autogenerated and added under the
                          key `ServerApp.token` to the secret which is created as a child of the custom
                          resource object.
                        - Setting the token to an empty string "" runs the Jupyter server container
                          itself without any authentication. This is recommended when enabling OIDC
                          as authentication and authorization are then handled by the dedicated plugins.
                        - Set an actual value here. Note that this string will be stored in clear text
                          as part of the custom resource object. This option is mostly useful for dev
                          purposes.
